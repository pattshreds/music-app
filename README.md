# music-app
Project two SEIR-mando

My original idea was to create an app that allows users to create their own playlists by uploading audio files. I was able to get the app working with some help from a classmate, but still not the way I had planned.

I started building this by organizing my folders, and getting a route setup to test the connections. After that I spent a lot of time working on the functionality and eventually styling. This app uses bcrypt, Cloudinary, dotenv, ejs, express, express-fileupload, express-session, method-override, and mongoose.

unsolved problems:

- Ability to upload multiple audio files into one playlist.
